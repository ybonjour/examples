# Examples
Example projects used as templates to play around with or demonstrate different technologies (e.g. JMeter, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes, atr, test-store)

The projects shall remain clean and simplistic and there should be no artifacts of the tested technologies in this repository.
Rather the projects should be copied to a new repository.
